Welcome to the NutritionInfo app.

Using the NutritionInfo app is easy. Just enter a food item
when prompted and NutritionInfo will search the Nutritionix Nut
rition Database and print information to the console for that food item. 

The Nutritionix Nutrition Database API was used for this app:
https://market.mashape.com/msilverman/nutritionix-nutrition-database

Data was pulled from the database using the term entered by the user as
well as the fields listed in the API.cs file. An API key was also used 
in a header for the GET request.
